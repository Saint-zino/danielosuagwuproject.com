            <p>
                CSS (<em>Cascading stylesheet</em>) selectors is used to target specific
                HTML element to be styled by the declaration. <br /><br />
                Below is a table that describes the basic CSS Selectors used in styling
                a HTML webpage.

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">S/N</th>
                    <td style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">SELECTORS</td>
                    <td style="font-weight: bold; color: white;">DEFINITION</td>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">1.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">Type</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        The Type selector matches the type of the element in the HTML
                        document. Example of Type selector below: <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;p</span> { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="light-green">&nbsp;color</span>:
                            <span class="blue">green</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">2.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">Universal</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        The Universal selector selects all elements of a given type.
                        <br />
                        The universal selector uses the * character in the same place
                        where you specified the type selector in a ruleset, like so:
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;*</span>{ <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="light-green">&nbsp;font-family</span>:
                            <span class="red">Verdana</span>; <br />&nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">3.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">Class</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        When working with HTML and CSS a class attribute is one of the
                        most common ways to select an element. <br /><br />
                        For example, consider the following HTML: <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;&ltp</span>
                            <span class="lime">class</span>=<span class="gold">'brand'</span>&gtSole Shoe Company<span
                                class="red">&lt/p&gt</span>
                            <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        The paragraph element in the example above has a class attribute
                        within the opening tag of the element. <br />
                        The class attribute is set to 'brand'. To select this element
                        using CSS, we can create a ruleset with a class selector of
                        .brand. <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="lime">&nbsp;.brand</span> { <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br />
                        To select an HTML element by its class using CSS, a period (.)
                        must be prepended to the class’s name. In the example above, the
                        class is brand, so the CSS selector for it is .brand. <br /><br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">4.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">Multiple Classes</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        We can use CSS to select an HTML element’s class attribute by
                        name. And so far, we’ve selected elements using only one class
                        name per element. If every HTML element had a single class, all
                        the style information for each element would require a new class.
                        <br /><br />

                        Luckily, it’s possible to add more than one class name to an HTML
                        element’s class attribute. <br /><br />
                        For instance, perhaps there’s a heading element that needs to be
                        green and bold. You could write two CSS rulesets like so:
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="lime">&nbsp;.green</span> { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="light-green">&nbsp;color</span>
                            <span class="blue">green</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                            <span class="lime">&nbsp;.bold</span> { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="light-green">&nbsp;font-weight</span>:
                            <span class="purple">bold</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        Then, you could include both of these classes on one HTML element
                        like this: <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;&lth1</span>
                            <span class="lime">class</span>=<span class="gold">'green bold'</span><span
                                class="red">&gt</span> ...<span class="red">&lt/h1&gt</span>
                            <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute
                        by separating them with a space. This enables us to mix and match
                        CSS classes to create many unique styles without writing a custom
                        class for every style combination needed.
                        <br /><br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">5.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">ID</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        Oftentimes it’s important to select a single element with CSS to
                        give it its own unique style. If an HTML element needs to be
                        styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the id attribute.
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;&lth1</span>
                            <span class="lime">id</span>=<span class="gold">'large-title'</span><span
                                class="red">&gt</span> ...
                            <span class="red">&lt/h1&gt</span> <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        In contrast to class which accepts multiple values, and can be
                        used broadly throughout an HTML document, an element’s id can only
                        have a single value, and only be used once per page. <br /><br />
                        To select an element’s ID with CSS, we prepend the id name with a
                        number sign (#). For instance, if we wanted to select the HTML
                        element in the example above, it would look like this:
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            &nbsp;#large-title {
                            <br /><br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        The id name is large-title, therefore the CSS selector for it is
                        #large-title.
                        <br /><br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td style="color: white;">6.</td>
                    <td style="color: white;">Attribute</td>
                    <td>
                        <br />
                        The attribute selector can be used to target HTML elements that
                        already contain attributes. Elements of the same type can be
                        targeted differently by their attribute or attribute value. This
                        alleviates the need to add new code, like the class or id
                        attributes. <br /><br />
                        Attributes can be selected similarly to types, classes, and IDs
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;[href]</span>{ <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="light-green">&nbsp;color</span>
                            <span class="blue">magenta</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        The most basic syntax is an attribute surrounded by square
                        brackets. In the above example: [href] would target all elements
                        with an href attribute and set the color to magenta. <br /><br />
                        And it can get more granular from there by adding type and/or
                        attribute values. One way is by using type[attribute*=value]. In
                        short, this code selects an element where the attribute contains
                        any instance of the specified value. Let’s take a look at an
                        example. <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;&ltimg</span>
                            <span class="lime">src</span>=<span
                                class="gold">'/images/seasons/cold/winter.jpg'</span><span class="red">&gt</span>
                            <br /><br />
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;&ltimg</span>
                            <span class="lime">src</span>=<span
                                class="gold">'/images/seasons/warm/summer.jpg'</span><span class="red">&gt</span>
                            <br /><br />
                        </div>

                        The HTML code above renders two <img /> elements, each containing
                        a src attribute with a value equaling a link to an image file.
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;img</span>[<span class="blue">src</span>*=<span
                                class="gold">'winter'</span>] { <br />
                            <span class="light-green">&nbsp;height</span>
                            <span class="red">50px</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />

                            <span class="red">&nbsp;img</span>[<span class="blue">src</span>*=<span
                                class="gold">'summer'</span>] { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="light-green">&nbsp;height</span>
                            <span class="red">100px</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        Now take a look at the above CSS code. The attribute selector is
                        used to target each image individually. <br />
                        • The first ruleset looks for an img element with an attribute of
                        src that contains the string 'winter', and sets the height to
                        50px. <br />
                        • The second ruleset looks for an img element with an attribute of
                        src that contains the string 'summer', and sets the height to
                        100px. <br />
                        Notice how no new HTML markup (like a class or id) needed to be
                        added, and we were still able to modify the styles of each image
                        independently. This is one advantage to using the attribute
                        selector!

                        You may have observed how the appearance of certain elements can
                        change, or be in a different state, after certain user
                        interactions. For instance: <br />
                        • When you click on an &ltinput&gt element, and a blue border is
                        added showing that it is in focus. <br />
                        • When you click on a blue &lta&gt link to visit to another page,
                        but when you return the link’s text is purple. <br />
                        • When you’re filling out a form and the submit button is grayed
                        out and disabled. But when all of the fields have been filled out,
                        the button has color showing that it’s active. <br />
                        These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action! In
                        fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all
                        pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site navigation,
                        and position in the document tree can all give elements a
                        different state with pseudo-class. <br />
                        A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always
                        written as a colon : followed by a name. For example p:hover.
                        <br /><br />
                        <div class="highlight">
                            <span class="red">&nbsp;p:hover</span> { <br />
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="light-green">&nbsp;background-color</span>
                            <span class="blue">lime</span>; <br />
                            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
                        </div>
                        <br /><br />
                        In the above code, whenever the mouse hovers over a paragraph
                        element, that paragraph will have a lime-colored background.
                        <br /><br />
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>
            Specificity is the order by which the browser decides which CSS styles
            will be displayed. A best practice in CSS is to style elements while
            using the lowest degree of specificity so that if an element needs a new
            style, it is easy to override. <br /><br />
            IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and
            finally, type. For example, consider the following HTML and CSS:
        </p>
        <p class="highlight">
            <span class="red">&nbsp;&lth1</span> class=<span class="gold">'headline'</span><span
                class="red">&gt</span>Breaking News<span class="red">&lt/h1&gt</span>
            <br /><br />
            <span class="red">&nbsp;h1</span> { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="light-green">&nbsp;color</span>
            <span class="blue">red</span>; <br />
            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
            <span class="lime">&nbsp;.headline</span> { <br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="light-green">&nbsp;color</span>
            <span class="blue">firebrick</span>; <br />
            &nbsp;} <br /><br />
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            In the example code above, the color of the heading would be set to
            firebrick, as the class selector is more specific than the type
            selector. If an ID attribute (and selector) were added to the code
            above, the styles within the ID selector’s body would override all other
            styles for the heading. <br /><br />
            Over time, as files grow with code, many elements may have IDs, which
            can make CSS difficult to edit since a new, more specific style must be
            created to change the style of an element. <br /><br />
            To make styles easy to edit, it’s best to style with a type selector, if
            possible. If not, add a class selector. If that is not specific enough,
            then consider using an ID selector.
